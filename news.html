                  <p>May 2021</p>
                  <p>
                    The <a href="https://www.webaudioconf2021.com">Web Audio Conference 2021</a> will take place
                    between July 5th and 7th 2021 in Barcelona.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  	In the context of the <a href="https://trompamusic.eu/">TROMPA project</a>, we wrote a paper about
                  	<b>CANTAMUS</b>: an online platform for choir rehearsals that combines the latest research on
                  	singing voice synthesis with an algortithm for the assessment of the singers' intonation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  	We co-authored this paper with <a href="https://www.voctrolabs.com/">Voctro Labs</a>, a company
                  	based in Barcelona, and also partners of the TROMPA project. They were in charge of the development of the
                  	platform, while we (UPF) developed the intonation assessment algorithm that allows the singer to get feedback
                  	about how accurate their singing was in each note of a singing performance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  	The paper is co-authored with Matan Gover, Álvaro Sarasua, Hector Parra, Jordi Janer, and Oscar Mayor
                  	from Voctro Labs, and Aggelos Gkiokas, Pili Pascual, and Emilia Gómez from MTG-UPF. Here's the paper reference,

                    (Oct 12th-15th) in a virtual form. We presented three papers related to our research
                    on polyphonic vocal music:

                      In the three poster sessions (on Slack!) we had very interesting discussions with other attendees,
                      and got really useful feedback to continue our work on the topic.

                    <h3>New academic year, new teaching</h3>
                    <p>October 23rd 2020</p>

                    This month we start a new academic year at UPF. I am a teaching assistant of the undergraduate
                    course <b>Acoustic Engineering</b>, and I'm in charge of the labs and part of the seminars of the course.
                    We have 33 students enrolled in the course this year, which is especially challenging due to covid-19
                    circumstances. We started off the academic year with a <b>hybrid teaching</b> strategy: lectures and labs
                    were supposed to happen remotely, while seminars should be in-person. However, we keep changing plans
                    follwing the new restrictions, and we moved to a full-online course soon after we started.
                    <p>
                      This new online teaching situation is very challenging for everyone: teachers and students. Although
                      we're doing our best to be connected and help students make the best out of the class, it's
                      sometimes difficult to engage them in the activities. We adopted a flipped-classroom-like style for
                      the course, which basically means that we give the students the content in the form of videos
                      or documents, and then host live Q&A sessions with them. While some of them actively attend these
                      sessions and interact with each other, the majority are just passively attending the sessions.
                      While this is a perfectly valid option, it might not be ideal for the learning process.
                      We'll see how this evolves throughout the term, and try to adapt to the circumstances as good as we can.
                    </p>
